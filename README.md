# Admin Dashboard

## <u>The Brief</u>
This is the Admin Dashboard project as part of The Odin Project.

We are required to build a full dashboard design webpage based off a provided sample design. It is a layout project and will not have any functionality at this stage. It is advised that we lean heavily on CSS Grid for the layout as that is what the lessons leading up to this project have been focusing on.

We are to gather assets like SVGs, fonts and other images to recreate the design in our own style.
